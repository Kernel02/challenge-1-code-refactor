## Description

This project was done to better help anyone who might be viewing this code. The HTML previously had no semantic elements and code was often repeated in the CSS. I used my foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS to improve the code. Not only was I able to make this code easier to view and work on, but I learned new information along the way. I learned new HTML semantic elements, such as nav, article and aside. In addition, I learned more about which properties in CSS will inherit to child properties and how to inherit properties that wouldn't inherit naturally.
